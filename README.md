First year first semester game.

Requirments stated that we were not to have any graphics, except what could be accomplished in ascii, what so ever.
Inspired by Sid Meier's Civilization and Dwarf Fortress, this is a turn based strategy game in which players must defeat their opponents Mainframe.

Featuring both singleplayer and local multiplayer, and proceedural generation of maps.
Sadly some of the assets were unrecoverable.
